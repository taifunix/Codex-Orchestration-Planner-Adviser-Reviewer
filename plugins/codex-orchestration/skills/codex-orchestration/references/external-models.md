# External Models

External Models lets Codex Orchestration assign audited non-picker models to bounded
roles. The current Codex task model remains root. The subsystem never writes the
top-level Codex `model` or `model_provider`, never adds an external model to the
Desktop picker, and never reads or deletes chats, sessions, or OpenAI auth.

## Trust lanes

Only two lanes are accepted:

1. A bundled, reviewed native provider manifest using HTTPS and the Responses API,
   plus command-backed authentication and provider-pinned personal custom agents.
2. A bundled, reviewed first-party subscription CLI adapter. Claude Fable 5, Claude Opus 5, and Claude Sonnet 5 use this lane and retain the no-tools/no-persistence,
   first-party-login, mechanical runtime model metadata bridge. Fable and Opus are
   sealed to Planner/Advisor operations; Claude Sonnet 5 is sealed to the Reviewer `review_code` operation.

An arbitrary URL, model ID, effort, shell command, project-local helper, or generic
subscription CLI is not a provider. Additions require code review, exact schemas,
negative tests, and a new plugin release.

## Lifecycle

The native lifecycle is:

```text
UNCONFIGURED -> AUTH_REQUIRED -> AUTH_READY -> CAPABILITY_VERIFIED
             -> ROLE_STAGED -> RESTART_REQUIRED -> READY
             -> ROUTE_ACCEPTED -> USED_CONFIRMED (only with mechanical metadata)
```

`CLI_CHANGED`, `CONFIG_DRIFT`, `ROLE_COLLISION`, and `RECOVERY_REQUIRED` block use.
No state may skip an unlisted transition. Provider self-report or model-authored text
never establishes `USED_CONFIRMED`.

## Seat-label entry

A built-in seat label may select a bundled External Model without putting that model
in the Desktop picker. The currently bundled shorthand is case-insensitive
`Designer: Kimi K3`, which means task-local role `designer`, provider `openrouter`,
exact model `moonshotai/kimi-k3`, and effort `max`. Omitted effort or `auto` resolves
to `max`; every other explicit effort is rejected. Similar labels are accepted only
after a reviewed plugin release adds an unambiguous bundled mapping.

Root must inspect external status before acting. Dispatch by exact state:

| Exact state | Action |
| --- | --- |
| Provider absent | Preview and apply clean preparation, then stop for user-owned hidden authentication. |
| Authentication missing | Print the no-paste enrollment guidance and stop. |
| Tuple unqualified | Request separate billing approval immediately before one Gate 0; never infer approval from the seat label. |
| Qualified provider, role absent | Preview and apply `connect` for role `designer` with the bounded Designer purpose. |
| `RESTART_REQUIRED` | Require a full Desktop restart and new task; do not delegate. |
| Exact role `READY` | Run sealed `invoke` with the bounded packet on stdin. Never use native `agents.spawn_agent` for an External Model. |
| Role mismatch, drift, shadow, or ambiguity | Stop with the exact blocker; never overwrite, disconnect, repair, or substitute. |

The explicit seat label authorizes clean preparation and clean role creation, just as
the equivalent literal configure request does. It never authorizes credential entry,
Gate 0 billing, a failed-probe retry, replacement, or deletion. External seat routes
remain task-local and are never stored in native routing state. Preserve any supplied
seats and original task across authentication, qualification, or restart boundaries.
Adding a role stages a new restart boundary and temporarily blocks other External
Model roles on that provider until `ready` succeeds or the staged role is disconnected;
native GPT routes, the root model, chats, and sessions remain untouched. Clean
preparation may add the exact audited OpenRouter provider entry when absent, but it
never modifies, replaces, or removes a pre-existing provider entry.

## Preview-first setup

Run the packaged script from the installed skill directory with Python 3.11+ and the
Codex binary used by the active host. Global options precede the subcommand.

Preview and apply provider preparation:

```bash
python3 <skill-dir>/scripts/external_configurator.py \
  --codex-bin <active-codex-binary> prepare --provider openrouter

python3 <skill-dir>/scripts/external_configurator.py \
  --codex-bin <active-codex-binary> prepare --provider openrouter --apply
```

Preparation adds only `[model_providers.openrouter]` and its command-backed `auth`
table through App Server compare-and-swap. It refuses an existing provider ID. It
installs a non-secret helper at
`<CODEX_HOME>/codex-orchestration/bin/external_auth_helper.py` and prints an
enrollment command.

Root must say:

```text
External provider authentication is required. Do not paste the API key into this
chat. Run the displayed enrollment command in a trusted local terminal; its hidden
local prompt stores the key in your operating-system credential store. Tell me when
that command succeeds.
```

Root must not run the enrollment command on the user's behalf because only the user
may enter the key outside chat. macOS uses Keychain, Linux uses Secret Service via
`secret-tool`, and Windows uses Credential Manager. Linux without Secret Service may
use an absolute, single-link executable only after previewing and explicitly adding
`--user-helper <path> --trust-user-helper`; the helper must print only the bearer
value to stdout and receives no stdin. Treat that helper as trusted code. Byte or
path drift blocks it as `CLI_CHANGED`.

After intentional same-path helper replacement, preview and apply
`trust-helper --provider <id>` (optionally with `--helper <same-absolute-path>`).
Re-trust clears qualification and requires authentication plus Gate 0 again. A path
change requires disconnecting roles and re-preparing the provider; it is never
silently accepted.

Every role resolution re-attests the provider manifest/version, exact App Server
provider table, qualification and readiness, credential-helper bytes, credential
availability, selected model capability declaration, and selected agent-file bytes.
Any missing file or drift fails closed before delegation. Adding a second role for
an already-ready provider is supported, but stages a new restart boundary; existing
roles remain blocked until the new role is validated with `ready` or disconnected.

After enrollment, Gate 0 requires explicit cost approval:

```bash
python3 <skill-dir>/scripts/external_configurator.py \
  --codex-bin <active-codex-binary> gate0 \
  --provider openrouter \
  --model moonshotai/kimi-k3 \
  --effort max \
  --acknowledge-billing
```

Before a billable command, Gate 0 verifies that the pinned Codex binary advertises
every required CLI control. It then uses a temporary `CODEX_HOME`, `codex exec
--ephemeral`, a read-only sandbox, a fixed prompt, and a bounded
`--output-last-message` artifact. Decorated stdout and stderr are discarded; only
that safe final-message artifact can satisfy the fixed signal. Success means the
exact provider/model/effort route accepted one request; it does not prove runtime
model identity.

Preview and create the role:

```bash
python3 <skill-dir>/scripts/external_configurator.py connect \
  --role researcher \
  --purpose "Gather evidence from the bounded packet and cite sources." \
  --provider openrouter \
  --model moonshotai/kimi-k3 \
  --effort max

python3 <skill-dir>/scripts/external_configurator.py connect \
  --role researcher \
  --purpose "Gather evidence from the bounded packet and cite sources." \
  --provider openrouter \
  --model moonshotai/kimi-k3 \
  --effort max \
  --apply
```

The configurator creates one personal provider-pinned agent per manifest-validated
effort. Start a new Codex task so Desktop loads those files, preview `ready`, then
apply it. Read-only `resolve --role researcher --effort max` remains available for
diagnostics. Execution uses the exact managed agent bytes as a sealed instruction;
the agent file still binds provider, model, and effort.

## Calling a role

Normalize forms such as these:

```text
call researcher at max — <bounded task>
use reviewer@high for <bounded task>
researcher: <bounded task> (effort max)
```

Send the bounded UTF-8 packet only on stdin (maximum 1 MiB):

```bash
python3 <skill-dir>/scripts/external_configurator.py \
  --codex-bin <absolute-active-host-codex-binary> \
  invoke --role researcher --effort max < packet.txt
```

`invoke` repeats all `resolve` integrity, qualification, authentication, role-file,
and workspace-shadow checks, then uses an isolated temporary `CODEX_HOME` and
`codex exec` with a read-only sandbox, ignored repository rules, and all
model-facing tools disabled. It first reads the exact binary's fail-closed feature
catalog, requires every transport-critical control, and emits disable flags for
every advertised targeted feature. The known cross-version optional `skill_search`
feature is already absent when unadvertised and receives no incompatible flag.
It accepts only a regular, single-link UTF-8 final
message of at most 2 MiB and returns machine-readable JSON. It never truncates,
retries, falls back, mutates lifecycle state, or exposes provider stdout/stderr.
The active-host binary must be an explicit absolute regular executable (PATH lookup
is forbidden), is fingerprinted and version-checked, and is re-fingerprinted before
launch. A nonzero exit, timeout, changed binary, unsafe artifact, or drift returns a
generic redacted failure. `READY` means only that the role, provider configuration,
authentication helper, and managed agent satisfy local readiness checks. It does
not attest the active binary, CLI flags, feature catalog, upstream uptime, or
runtime model identity; those invocation controls are checked by sealed `invoke`.

On POSIX, timeout cleanup kills the new process group. On Windows, invocation uses
a new process group, requests a group break, then hard-kills the direct child if it
does not exit. Because model tools are disabled, the design creates no model-facing
long-lived descendants; Windows cannot promise Unix-style descendant enumeration.

## Status, disconnect, and removal

`status` is read-only and makes no model call. It reports non-secret provider auth,
config integrity, qualification, role state, loaded variant names, and file
integrity.

Preview and apply `disconnect --role <id>` to remove only exact managed role files.
The provider stays prepared. Preview and apply `remove-provider --provider <id>` only
after its last role is disconnected. Removal requires an exact registry record and
exact current provider table. Edited or ambiguous state is preserved and becomes a
manual recovery case. Neither command traverses chat/session directories or touches
OpenAI auth.

## Stored state and secrets

The registry and recovery journal are strict schema-1 JSON files at the top of
`CODEX_HOME`, mode `0600` on POSIX. They store IDs, paths, hashes, states, timestamps,
and non-secret ownership metadata. Unknown fields and keys containing `api_key`,
`authorization`, `bearer`, `credential`, `password`, `secret`, or `token` fail
closed. They never store prompt packets, model output, keys, account IDs, or chat
content.

The bearer value crosses one unavoidable boundary: the OS credential helper prints
it to the Codex provider process on stdout, as required by Codex command-backed
authentication. Surrounding logs and errors withhold helper and provider output.
The key is never copied into invocation argv, environment, temporary config, packet,
registry, journal, output, or error text; the isolated config retains only the exact
command-backed helper reference.

## Adding another provider

Every new native provider requires:

- one exact manifest in `providers/`, with HTTPS base URL, `wire_api = responses`,
  exact model IDs, exact effort allowlists, evidence source, and initial
  qualification state;
- an auth strategy using OS secure storage or a separately pinned absolute helper;
- an isolated Gate 0 test for every newly qualified model/effort tuple;
- malformed-schema, collision, auth failure, drift, rollback, redaction, and route
  identity tests;
- documentation of provider retention/privacy terms and the difference between
  route acceptance and runtime identity;
- a plugin version bump and fresh final-tree security review.

Every new subscription provider additionally requires an official first-party CLI,
audited login-status semantics, a fixed no-tools/no-persistence invocation, a sealed
operation allowlist, mechanical runtime model metadata, CLI re-attestation behavior,
and dedicated redaction tests. Do not generalize Fable's adapter into arbitrary CLI
execution.

## Kimi K3 status

As verified from OpenRouter's official model page and public endpoint metadata on
2026-07-18, `moonshotai/kimi-k3` is listed with context `1048576`, a live
Responses-compatible endpoint, and support for the reasoning parameter. OpenRouter
currently documents only `max` reasoning for Kimi K3. The plugin therefore accepts
`max`, lets `auto` resolve to `max`, and rejects `xhigh`, `high`, `medium`, `low`,
`minimal`, and `none` without clamping. The auto-compaction limit remains `950000`.

The bundled adapter is no longer experimental, but official listing evidence is not
per-install route qualification. Every installation starts unqualified and must pass
one explicitly authorized, potentially billable Gate 0 for the exact
OpenRouter/Kimi/max tuple before role creation. Upstream capacity may return `429`;
that is a failed probe and must not be retried without renewed approval. Do not
replace the exact model ID with a dated or `latest` alias.
